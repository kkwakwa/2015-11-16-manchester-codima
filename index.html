<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Download the Git for Windows
	<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">installer</a>. Run the
        installer. <strong>Important: on the 6th page of the installation wizard (the
        page titled `Configuring the terminal emulator...`) select `Use Windows'
        default console window`. If you forgot to do this programs that you need
        for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the
        installer and select the appropriate option.</strong> This will provide you
        with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.

  <h3>GAP</h3>

  <p>
    GAP is a system for discrete computational algebra. It provides a programming
    language, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms
    written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects.
    Its latest version may be found on the
    <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/">GAP Downloads page</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        From the <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/">GAP Downloads page</a>,
        download the <code>.exe</code> installer and double click on the file to run it. When you
        will be asked for the installation path, note that it should not contain spaces.
        For example, you may install GAP in <code>C:\gap4r7</code> (default),
        <code>D:\gap4r7p8</code> or <code>C:\Math\GAP\gap4r7</code>, but you must not
        install it in a directory named like <code>C:\Program files\gap4r7</code> or
        <code>C:\Users\alice\My Documents\gap4r7</code> etc.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">OS X</h4>
      <p>
        On OS X, we suggest to install GAP using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.
        After installing Homebrew, open the Terminal and call
        <code>brew install homebrew/science/gap --with-InstPackages</code>.
        Please be patient - this may take a while. If Homebrew is already installed
        on your Mac, you may have to call <code>brew update</code> first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you may also install GAP from source as explained at the
        <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Releases/">GAP Downloads page</a>.
        The BOB installer, suggested in the next column for Linux, is also available
        for OS X.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        We suggest to use an
        <a href="http://gap-system.github.io/bob/">alternative GAP source installer BOB</a>
        which will first check whether everything it needs from your system is installed and
        if not it will warn you and tell you what is needed.
        Please see <a href="http://gap-system.github.io/bob/">BOB</a>
        page for further instructions. To be able to compile GAP you may need to install
        some tools as described <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/Download/tools.html">here</a>.
        Alternatively, you may also install GAP from source as explained at the

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
